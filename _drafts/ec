FFmpeg has been built without libfaac for licensing reasons;
libvo-aacenc is used by default.
To install with libfaac, you can:
  brew reinstall ffmpeg --with-faac

You can also use the experimental FFmpeg encoder, libfdk-aac, or
libvo_aacenc to encode AAC audio:
  ffmpeg -i input.wav -c:a aac -strict experimental output.m4a
Or:
  brew reinstall ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac
  ffmpeg -i input.wav -c:a libfdk_aac output.m4a


Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:
LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/opencv3/lib
CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/opencv3/include
