There are lots of words in the world of start-ups and incubators that come from the sects and the religions :

- an **evangelist** is a very good marketer

- a **guru** is a leader attracting people, not because he is skilled, but because so many people follow him

- a **super-hero** is usually a very good developer, willing to change the world. The word is used very frequently in recrutement job desks

...

To say, today nobody feels ashamed to manipulate other people's mind : it has become normal. But it still remains immoral and certainly not the way to true success.

So what are the ingredients to build a start-up, or a sect if it is the same ?

Sectarism is much more a human phenomenon, very insidious, and difficult to detect and to understand while not being confronted to. Observing, comparing and searching for the common patterns in such organizations will make awareness.
