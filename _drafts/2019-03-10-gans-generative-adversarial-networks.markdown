Here is my course of deep learning in 5 days only! You might first check [Course 0: deep learning!](http://christopher5106.github.io/deep/learning/2018/10/20/course-zero-deep-learning.html), [Course 1: program deep learning!](http://christopher5106.github.io/deep/learning/2018/10/20/course-one-programming-deep-learning.html), [course 2: build deep learning networks!](http://christopher5106.github.io/deep/learning/2018/10/20/course-two-build-deep-learning-networks.html) and [course 3: natural language](http://christopher5106.github.io/deep/learning/2018/10/20/course-three-natural-language-and-deep-learning.html) if you have not read them.
