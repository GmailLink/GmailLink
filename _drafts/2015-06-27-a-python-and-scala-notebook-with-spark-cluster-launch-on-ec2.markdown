#Deploy a python and scala notebook server with Spark cluster launch on EC2

This article describes operations in my [spark-notebook-simple recipe](https://github.com/christopher5106/spark-notebook-simple). This recipe enables to launch an instance on EC2 and instantly have a notebook interface to program in Python and Scala and launch an Spark cluster with the desired number of nodes.

If you want to do it manually on your own, here are the different steps.

First install a Jupyter Hub following the [install manual](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub).

Download [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
