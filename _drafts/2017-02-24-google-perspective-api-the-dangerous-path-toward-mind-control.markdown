Google just released [Perspective API](http://www.perspectiveapi.com/) to evaluate the degree of "toxicity" in online comments. An API you can try yourself.

Such a word "toxic" triggers lot's of warnings in my mind.

The first question I have in mind is what "toxicity" does really mean.

In the dictionary, "toxic" means "poisonous", and "poisonous" means "causing or capable of causing death or illness if taken into the body".

*Is it possible a word or a sentence can cause death or illness ?*. Like the words I'm writing now ? WAOU.

### The business of toxicity

I have met so many managers in my life, that were behaving as **"toxic people" hunters**, such as [Manuel Diaz, CEO of Emakina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQDaOecdlhM) who openly speaks in his video about toxic people in a team.

After a while, I have also discovered lots of negativity and a lack of openmindness in these people who speak every day about how others are toxic to them: the paradox of their positivness.

*Toxic* is a word symptomatic of today's world. Let's see a bit more what is toxic or not toxic for Perspective API.


### Perspective API toxicity inference

**Toxic** is toxic. Good point.

**An insult** is toxic.

**Even more if it is fully spelled**.

So far so good.

But **Hitler** was toxic.

I can understand. Hitler caused lot's of deaths.

A **terrorist attack** is toxic :

How much toxic are **mushrooms** ??

Not so much. Ok, let's eat it :

**Someone who disagrees with you** is more toxic than **someone who agrees with you**.

That is where it becomes awkward, and begins to reveal the problem.


And let's go further.

**A woman** is more toxic than **a man**.

### The world we live in

Perspective API is typically the kind of initiative that does an "average", and averages are absolutely not good and have never been a solution to any issue, but are heavily used in politics. It is exactly as our brain does, creating prejudices. Shall we use articifial intelligence in order to become even sillier ?

This is the kind of initiative that goes against itself, is counterproductive, and leads to even more problems, a kind of manipulation, trying to keep our kids away from the real face of the world, and let them live in a dream world.

I truly believe the world we live in today is one of the saddest, due to the **positivness** of our "toxicity hunters", and their lack of understanding in the field of psychology. Positivness, when not linked to openmindness to what we believe negative or toxic, and toxicity, are the two sides of the same coin. It is the path to "judgements".

Moreover, silence can be considered, in psychology, as more violent and destroying than "words", even "toxic words". Speech is the courageous step to go forward, in the outside world, leaving the mother's womb. Violence takes its roots when speech has become muffled : so many violent people have a dictionary of not more than 500 words, and preventing them from expressing these words will directly lead to physical violence.

Today's managers have fully forgotten the importance of speech in our brain's development, and APIs such as Perspective API, can create as much disorder as the problem they try to solve. They build a verbal jail, or virtual jail, leading to even more madness.

There are good questions when speaking about *data*, *big data*, *machine learning*. Does that really improve our world ? Does it help us evolve towards a better world ?

**Sorry for people who might be offended by these results: these are only the results of agnostic technology, trained on public data. They can be used as a good starting point to explore our unconscious minds and our relationship with artificial intelligence. Perspective API sounds like encouraging us to live in a closed loop, when the opportunity to heal people has never been so great. But living in a closed world, might be what some politicians want for us**.
