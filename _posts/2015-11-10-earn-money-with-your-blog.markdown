After 10 articles, I got 1700 users per month. It's time to monetize it.

# Advertising with Google Adsense

Add advertising to your website with [Google Adsense](http://www.google.com/adsense)

Create an ad unit and add it to your website.

# Improve your search presence with Google Webmaster Tools

[Google Webmaster Tools](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools) has a search console to help you check your site, such as the presence of a sitemap, the display in search results... and will email you if any unusual event occurs, such a drop discontinuity for your search rank.

# Improve your sales with the right subjects and keywords :)

## Check your position in searches with Positeo

[Positeo](http://www.positeo.com/check-position/) helps you check your position in search results for some keywords.


## Get links from other websites

To improve your visibility in search results, the best is to get links from other websites with high page ranks. You can check the page ranks on [Page Rank websites](http://www.pagerank.fr).

Getting links from websites of page rank 4 is a good start.

Media websites have usually page ranks above 8, such as  [Le Monde journal's page rank](http://www.pagerank.fr/rapport-indexation.fr.html?uri=www.lemonde.fr).
