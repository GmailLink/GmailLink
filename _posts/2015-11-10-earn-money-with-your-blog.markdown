# Improve your page rank thanks to links from other websites

To improve your visibility in search results, the best is to get links from other websites with high page ranks. You can check the page ranks on [Page Rank websites](http://www.pagerank.fr).

Getting links from websites of page rank 4 is a good start.

Media websites have usually page ranks above 8, such as  [Le Monde journal's page rank](http://www.pagerank.fr/rapport-indexation.fr.html?uri=www.lemonde.fr).
