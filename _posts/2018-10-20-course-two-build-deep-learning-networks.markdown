Here is my course of deep learning in 5 days only!

You might first check [Course 0: deep learning!](http://christopher5106.github.io/deep/learning/2018/10/20/course-zero-deep-learning.html) and [Course 1: program deep learning!](http://christopher5106.github.io/deep/learning/2018/10/20/course-one-programming-deep-learning.html) if you have not read them.



# Under construction

a recurrent network is a feedforward network with two inputs

Batch normalization
statistics at the output are
variance 1, mean 0
training layers on statistics not changning
learning a scale and a bias after normalization
