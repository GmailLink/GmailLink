In this post, I'll give some explanations about [Embedding Symbolic Knowledge into Deep Networks paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01161).

In particular:

1/ what are the features X of leaf nodes in the symbolic knowledge embedder ?

2/ How is computed the embedding of the formula ?

3/ How do we link formula satisfaction and model predictions during training ?
