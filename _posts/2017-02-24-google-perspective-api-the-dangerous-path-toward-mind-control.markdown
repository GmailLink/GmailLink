Google just released [Perspective API](http://www.perspectiveapi.com/) to evaluate the degree of "toxicity" in online comments.

Such a word "toxic" triggers lot's of warnings in my mind. The first question I have in mind is what does "toxicity" really mean. In the dictionary, "toxic" means "poisonous", and "poisonous" means "causing or capable of causing death or illness if taken into the body.". *Is it possible a word or a sentence can cause death ?*

### The business of toxicity

I have met so many managers in my life, that were behaving as **toxic people hunters**, such as [Manuel Diaz, CEO of Emakina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQDaOecdlhM) who speaks in his videao about toxic people in a team. I have also discovered lots of negativity and a lack of openness in these people who speak every day about how others are toxic to them.

*Toxic* is a word symptomatic of today's world. Let's see a bit more what is toxic or not toxic for Perspective API.


### Perspective API toxicity inference

**Toxic** is more toxic.

**Someone who disagrees** is more toxic than **someone who agrees with you**.

That is where it becomes awkward, and begins to reveal the problem.


And let's go further.

### The world we live

I truly believe the world we live in today is one of the saddest, due to the **positivness** of our "toxicity hunters", and their lack of understanding in the field of psychology. Positivness, when not linked to openmindness to what we believe negative or toxic, and toxicity, are the two sides of the same coin.

Moreover, silence is, in psychology, considered as as violent and destroying as "words" and in particular "toxic words". Speech is the courageous step to go forward, in the outside world, leaving the mother's womb.

Today's managers have fully forgotten the importance of speech in our brain development, and APIs such as Perspective API, can create as much disorder as the problem they try to solve.
